# Artificial Intelligence Capstone Project – Black-Box Optimization (BBO)

## Project Goals and Technologies

The project's goals and key technologies will be defined later.

## Weekly Progress

### Week 1

- Initialized project structure.
- Created virtual environment and installed dependencies (`numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`).
- Implemented `load_data` helper in `utils.py`.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including statistical summaries, visualizations, and feature importance
  analysis
  - Created `eda_analysis.ipynb` and `eda_analisys.py`
- Developed a Bayesian Optimization engine utilizing Gaussian Process Regression (Matern kernel) and Upper Confidence
  Bound (UCB) acquisition, featuring dynamic exploration-exploitation strategies and heuristic biased sampling for
  high-dimensional constraints.
